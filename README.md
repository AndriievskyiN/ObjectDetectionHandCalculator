# Object Detection Finger Calculator

The goal of this project is to make and deploy an object detection model that can recognize different amount of fingers on a hand. Moreover, it can recognize + and - signs demonstrated using fingers. It will write the expression that you showed (e.g. 5 + 3 + 2 - 1), and then you will be able to calculate the result.
